.SYNOPSIS
    EntraChecks-Compliance.psm1
    Optional module for compliance framework mapping and reporting

.DESCRIPTION
    This module maps security findings from Invoke-EntraChecks.ps1 and its modules
    to compliance frameworks (CIS Microsoft 365, NIST 800-53) and generates
    compliance-focused reports.
    
    Features:
    - Map findings to CIS Microsoft 365 Foundations Benchmark v3.0
    - Map findings to NIST 800-53 Rev 5 controls
    - Calculate compliance scores
    - Identify compliance gaps
    - Export HTML and CSV compliance reports
    
.NOTES
    Version: 1.0.0
    Author: David Stells
    Requires: Findings from Invoke-EntraChecks.ps1 or modules
    
    No additional licenses required - uses existing findings.
